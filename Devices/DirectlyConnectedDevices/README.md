For Microsoft Field IoT Labs, you'll want to use one of the following labs. Each folder contains a readme file with further step-by-step instructions.

These are simplified versions of the client code, designed to help the lab participants focus on accomplishing their goal of getting data to Azure, and analyzing it. They may be built upon using other pieces from the larger Connect the Dots, or expanded to use additional sensors included in the FEZ HAT.
